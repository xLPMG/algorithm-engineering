# Algorithm Engineering

This repository contains my work for the Algorithm Engineering course at FSU Jena, completed during the Winter Semester 2025/26.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main components:

### 1. Weekly Exam Assignments

Each lecture includes a set of Exam Assignments (questions and programming tasks) related to the week’s topic.
All solutions are located in the `answers` directory, organized by lecture.
Each lecture folder typically includes:

* `report.md` — written answers and explanations
* `code/` — directory with corresponding source code files

### 2. C++ Project

The course also involves developing a standalone C++ project, which can be found in the `project` directory.
This section includes the complete source code, documentation, and related resources.

### 3. Research Paper

The final component is a four-page paper based on the C++ project.
All materials for this paper are contained in the `paper` directory.
